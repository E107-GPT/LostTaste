All of the music in the Karugamo BGM series are mainly in the orchestral style and not "too realistic" to go for a medium/small-sized games. In addition, the volume of these musics are adjusted in good order, for example, the volume of music for a pastoral village is never louder than a gigantic boss fight, and therefore it is easily added to your game projects.

And there files are 2 types per track that are written as below.

1. KBF_xxx_yyy_01.ogg
If it is played with the asset "Karugamo Audio Manager" that is included with the music files, it can be made to play in a seamless loop. Incidentally, the loop method is the same as RPGMaker series.

2. KBF_3m_xxx_yyy_01.ogg
If you don't use the above asset, you should use this type. Its length is about 3 to 4 minutes and it fades out at the end.
